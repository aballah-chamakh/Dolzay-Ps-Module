List of destruction : 

- the Minor destruction executed once the plugin is installed 
	detail : 
		- remove all of the code in dolzay.php related to the database
	 	- remove the traces of adding the hidden code 
	goal : 
		- remove the traces of the hidden route 
		- if the client did capture a version of the plugin after the minor destruction this will prevent the re-install of this version 
          which will make the client unabled to re-install the plugin after the destruction also he can't hand it to other clients 
	how it can be bypassed : 
	   	- if the client captured the original version of the plugin
		- if the client capture the structure of the tables from phpMyAdmin and asked chatgpt to generate a sql statement for that 
	test : 
		- the functionalities of the plugin works correctly
			- submit (done)
			- address form with the city and the delegation dropdowns
		- can't re-install the plugin after the uninstallation
		
- the destruction executed once the user request it remotely :
	detail : remove all the code related to the plugin except for the code that shows up the payment popup 
	goal :
		- in case of the automated destruction failed we can hard destruct it remotely
	bypass : 
		- find it through having the orginal copy of the plugin and looking for his of the plugin
		- cracking the plugin 
		- restoring the plugin to it's orginal state each time it get destroyed 
	tests/checks : 
		- the delete of all of the files and directories except for the must stay
		- dolzay.php and order_submit_process.js were updated to show only the payment popup 
		- the tabs were deleted 
		- the delegation fields was removed from the address format 
		- the delegation field was remove remove from the Address Table 
		- the address form works without errors

- the false path of blockage 
  	detail : block the plugin the if the domain name of client isn't the expected one or the plugin did expire
	goal : give the perception to the cracker that he did crack the plugin 
	tests : 
		- it block the launch order submit process once if plugin did expire 
		- it doesn't destroy the plugin
	
- destruction triggered through the js of order_submit_process.js 
	detail : 
		- add a destruction route whitin the plugin so that even when the traces the of destruction route that exists 
                  outside the plugin were deleted and another client tries to install the plugin we will still have a route from within 
		  the plugin to which we can ask for the destruction of the plugin from js 
		- we will put the destruction code within the notification list route and we trigger that code throught asking for the list of 				  notifications in js
		- the destruction code destroys the plugin only the plugin
	goal : 
	     - destroy the plugin once he tries to submit the orders and the plugin did expire 
	bypass : 
	     - cracking the plugin 
	tests/checks : 
	     - the plugin gets destroyed when the plugin did expire 
		- the delete of all of the files and directories except for the must stay
		- dolzay.php and order_submit_process.js were updated to show only the payment popup 
		- the tabs were deleted 
		- the delegation fields was removed from the address format 
		- the delegation field was remove remove from the Address Table 
		- the address form works without errors

note : 
	- why we have a destruction route outsite the plugin : to make it hard for the cracker to know where it exists


the simplest approache  : 
- the false path blockage 
- the destruction triggered from js 
	- needs a route for the destruction added in the plugin
	- the struction can exist in the osp
